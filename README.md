# ApproximatingPiThroughCollisions

With all the free time I've had, It has been interesting to work on some cool projects, or in this case, a simulation of ideal elastic collisions that approximates the value of Pi. A video explaining the math behind it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE , which is definitely worth checking out because it's pretty cool. 

Without further adieu, I'm pretty sure you would like to see the simulation in action, so I'm going to attach my own video here (and I based the code example off of this cool video here: https://youtu.be/PoW8g67XNxA, though in the video it is written in P5 Javascript and not Processing Java like I used)

I haven't actually attached a video because I'm not sure it is necessary given the code train video, but I will consider it
